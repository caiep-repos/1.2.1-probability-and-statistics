# Basic Statistics Calculation

## Problem Description

In this assignment, you will implement functions to calculate basic statistical measures: mean, median, and mode.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand and implement mean, median, and mode.
- Practice basic Python programming.

## Setup Instructions

1.  Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Instructions

1.  Open the `assignment.py` file.
2.  You will find three function definitions: `calculate_mean`, `calculate_median`, and `calculate_mode`.
3.  Your tasks are to:
    *   **Task 1**: Implement the `calculate_mean` function to calculate the mean of a list of numbers.
    *   **Task 2**: Implement the `calculate_median` function to calculate the median of a list of numbers.
    *   **Task 3**: Implement the `calculate_mode` function to calculate the mode of a list of numbers.

## Testing Your Solution

Run the test file to verify your implementation:

```bash
python test.py
```
